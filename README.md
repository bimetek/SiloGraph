# Silo Graph

Qt GUI for silo/line/node info displaying.


## Supported Platforms

All major Linux distributions and Mac OS X. Should build with MinGW under
Windows if you handle lib paths correctly, but I don't guarentee anything.


## Dependencies

    Should install as shared library, and put headers and libs in searched
    paths.
